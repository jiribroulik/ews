very dumb, hacky, possibly flaky package to send emails from an Exchange server via EWS (in the event yours doesn't expose a SMTP server)

usage:

	b, err := ews.BuildTextEmail(
		"me@server.com",
		[]string{"friend@example.com", "someone@else.com"},
		"An email subject",
		[]byte("The email body, as plain text"))
	if err != nil {
		// handle err
	}
	resp, err := ews.Issue(
		"https://exhange.server.com/ews/Exchange.asmx",
                "domain",
		"username",
		"password",
		b)
	if err != nil {
		// handle err
	}
	if resp.StatusCode != 200 {
		// read body and figure out what happened
	}
	// read or ignore body; the email was sent

the other exported types are just the raw data structures for the request XML; you can ignore them

I'm not sure if I'll develop this further; feel free to (warning: here be SOAP)
some resources I used are in comments in the code

TODOs
- figure out why UTF-8 isn't used for email bodies, or how to force the encoding
